# EEG_signals
Mental attention states of human individuals (focused, unfocused and drowsy)

This is a collection of 4 experiments for monitoring of attention state in human individuals using passive EEG BCI.
Each Matlab file contains the object of the data acquired from EEG device during one experiment. The sampling frequency is 256 Hz. 
The list of data channels and their numerical ids is given below per EEG documentation.
The data were recorded in a room where participants were provided with a comfortable environment and a smart phone for game play. The sources of environmental noise were kept to a minimum by avoiding electric cabling near the setup. The wireless headset and the SDK were properly synchronised to avoid any error in EEG signal acquisition during the game play. Gameplay has different level of difficulty, which were mapped to the attentiveness of the user.
The average time taken to record the complete data for five turns for a single participant was 10 minutes. Since the expertise level cannot be reliably judged with a single turn, to be more rational, five turns were used.
